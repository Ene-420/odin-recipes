    <p>
        I have to admit, I have a weakness for jalapeno poppers. 
        As much as I love them, I’ve never made them at home, 
        because I’m not a fan of deep frying in my own kitchen. 
        These bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers are baked instead of fried, and let me say, they’re even better than the original! 
        Who can resist fresh jalapenos stuffed with cheese, wrapped in bacon and baked to crispy perfection? Not me, that’s for sure. 
        This is the ultimate party or game day snack.
