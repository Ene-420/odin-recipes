    <p>
        For those of you who are new to this recipe, 
        these Tex-Mex style chicken enchiladas are easy to make with a basic filling of sautéed chicken, 
        green chiles, onions, beans and shredded cheese. 
         Then they are rolled up in your choice of either flour or corn tortillas, 
         baked until hot and melty, and sprinkled with lots of fresh toppings. 
         But I have to say that the real magic of this recipe lies in the homemade red enchilada sauce that brings it all together. 
         This red enchilada sauce only requires a few extra minutes of prep time, but the flavor that it adds to these enchiladas is major.
